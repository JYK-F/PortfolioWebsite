Things 2 check

why the project page is not chnageing themes anymore


Future plans
change the theme buttons to be icons and stick to the top right of unm
fix StoryGame page


I changed
the name from chnage&plans to changelogs
the unm now chnages with theme
theme is now being loaded earlier (i hope)
i delted the call to the unm.css in the html pages
